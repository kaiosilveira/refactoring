# Refactoring

**This repository is a work in progress and is being constantly updated. Stay tuned!**

This repository is a working implementation of the refactoring patterns described in the "Refactoring" book, by Martin Fowler.

To keep things clean and to make each refactoring as detailed and precise as possible, this repo was organized using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), where each refactoring belongs to a separate git repository, added to this main repo as a reference.
